                            Question
======================================================================
- Write a program to check if the 2 trees are identical or not


                            Assumption
=========================================================================
- Input value is only integer
- Input values are stored in the form of binary search tree


                            Solution
=========================================================================
- Take size of the trees and elements of the trees from command line
- Store each element as a node of the tree
- Insertion of elements happen as per the rules of binary search tree


                            How to Run
========================================================================
- import this project in any of the java editors
- Run main method
- Input size of first tree
- Enter first tree elements
- Input size of second tree
- Enter second tree elements
- Algorithm will tell you, if 2 trees are identical or not
